This is in contrast to the CNE data type, which requires a code from a non-extendable value set be sent in the identifier code component (CNE.1) in all cases (except, of course, if the entire field is empty and defined as optional at the segment level). The rules for populating CWE components are governed by the status of the identifier code: Identifier Code Status Identifier Code (CWE.1) Descriptive Text (CWE.2) Coding System (CWE.3) Contained in model value set Populated May be populated Must be populated with model coding system, or (not recommended) sitespecific coding system that is a superset containing model values. Contained in sitespecific extensions to model value set Populated May be populated Site-specific coding system. Contained in neither model nor extended value sets Not populated May be populated with the identifier code, freetext description, or a concatenation of the two. Should be human interpretable. Must not be populated. Not supplied; but descriptive text is supplied. Not populated May be populated with descriptive text. Must not be populated. As an example, consider “currency” codes where:  The model values are defined by the ISO 4217 value set,  The value set is extended on site to include the code HL7 – “HL7 Drink Ticket”, and  The data entry screen on the sending system does not enforce any edits for the currency code. And so the value set used on site is: Identifier Code Status Model values from ISO 4217 external table Site-specific extension Identifier Code AED AFA ALL ZAR ZMK ZWD HL7 Descriptive Text United Arab Emirates, Dirhams Afghanistan, Afghanis Albania, Leke … South Africa, Rand Zambia, Kwacha Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Dollars HL7 Events, Drink Ticket Collectively, this value set must be referred to with a local coding system ID, because “HL7” does not exist in ISO 4217. According to the rules, the site assigns the coding system ID “99CUR” to the value set. Based on the code and descriptive text entered by the user on the sending system, the CWE would be populated as follows: Entered by user Sent in CWE Code Descriptive Text Identifier Code (CWE.1) Descriptive Text (CWE.2) Coding System (CWE.3) GBP Great Britain, Pound GBP Great Britain, Pound ISO4217 GBP Great Britain, Pound 99CUR (This option is NOT recommended) HL7 HL7 Drink Ticket HL7 HL7 Drink Ticket 99CUR XXX Must not be populated XXX Must not be populated. Must not be populated Bogus entry Must not be populated. Must not be populated XXX: Bogus entry Must not be populated. Must not be populated anything – or nothing. Must not be populated. Must not be populated Dollar Must not be populated. Valued from HL7 Table 0353 (e.g., “U” for unkown) Dollar HL70353 Dollar Notes: 1. Where multiple valid options for sending the entered data exist, each alternative is depicted as a separate row. 2. CWE.2 - Descriptive Text is never required, and there are no hard and fast rules on what text may be sent in this component. Of course, common sense suggests that if valued, the text should complement the identifier code of CWE.1. It follows that where CWE.1 cannot be valued because the entered code does not exist in the value set, the entered code may be sent in CWE.2; with or without additional descriptive text. However, this is not required by HL7. 3. The example with GBP shows two options for the code set: ISO4217 or 99CUR. While it is now technically possible to send 99CUR on the basis that this code may exist on its own in the extended local code set, HL7 urges that where a code is a member of the standard code set, that code set should be named in CWE.3. HL7 intends to mandate this in a future release. 4.",

It is not recommended to include values for entities such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) because they are included in the identifier type table. In these cases the name of the country plus the identifier type yields the correct interpretation of the identifier in component 1.

    "description": "The basic definition of the HD is that it identifies an (administrative or system or application or other) entity that has responsibility for managing or assigning a defined set of instance identifiers (such as placer or filler number, patient identifiers, provider identifiers, etc.). This entity could be a particular health care application such as a registration system that assigns patient identifiers, a governmental entity such as a licensing authority that assigns professional identifiers or drivers’ license numbers, or a facility where such identifiers are assigned. The HD is designed to be a more powerful and more general replacement for the application identifier of HL7 versions 2.1 and 2.2. It adds two additional components, the <universal ID> and the <universal ID type> to the former application ID (which is renamed more generically to be the namespace ID). In the case where an HD identifies an entity that assigns/creates instance identifiers such as a particular patient registration system, it defines an \"assigning authority\". In the case where an HD identifies a location where instance identifiers are given out (although they may be created by another entity at another location) such as a particular \"department of motor vehicles office location,\" it defines an \"assigning facility\". These two different uses of the HD appear in many of the extended data types. The \"assigning authority\" defined by the HD is similar in its role to the coding system (and version) part of the coded element data types: both identify a set of more discrete instance identifiers. The difference is that the set of HD-defined discrete instances contain identifiers of \"real-world\" things such as patient or clinical orders, while the coded element-defined set of discrete instances contains concept identifiers (codes). The HD is designed to be used either as a local identifier (with only the <namespace ID> valued) or a publicly-assigned identifier, a UID (<universal ID> and <universal ID type> both valued). Syntactically, the HD is a group of two identifiers: a local identifier defined by the first component and a universal identifier defined by the second and third components. HDs that have defined third components (defined UID types) must have a second component that is unique within the series of IDs defined by that component. Note: The HD is used in fields that in earlier versions of HL7 used the IS data type. Thus, a single component HD (only the first component valued) will look like a simple IS data type for older systems expecting a single component in the place of the HD data type. If the first component for the HD data type is present, the second and third components are optional. If the third component is present, then the second must also be present (although in this case the first is optional). The second and third components must either both be valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null). This means that if all three components of the HD are valued, the entity identified by the first component is the same as the entity identified by components two and three taken together. However, implementers may choose, by site agreement, to specify that if all three components of the HD are valued, the first component defines a member in the set defined by the second and third components.",

    "description": "This data type is used to represent channel-multiplexed waveform data. Assuming that fields that utilize this data type repeat and that Y represents the specific repetition, the components of the repetition will reflect sample Y from each channel. Usage Note: The MA data type is preferred when the signal recording device outputs the waveform data by time (all signal amplitudes at time sample 1, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 2, followed by all signal amplitudes at time sample 3, etc.). The typical count is 32, 64, or 128 channels. At the time of this writing, the MA data type is the one used by most commercial EEG instruments, while other electrophysiological instruments (such as evoked potential instruments) may use the NA data type. The MA data type is the \"natural\" one for multichannel EEG instruments since the signal acquisition process involves digitizing each channel in succession as rapidly as possible, then after a fixed interval (like 0.004 seconds) digitizing all the channels again in succession, and repeating this every 0.004 seconds as long as the recording continues. Conversion of one format to another is often not possible or desirable in near-real-time applications. For example, a long-term EEG recording may go on for 24, 48, 72, or more hours and implementations cannot wait until the recording is ended to transmit the data because physicians need to review the waveforms as the recording is in progress; this is why it only makes sense to organize the data by the MA data type which sends the data one time sample after the next. Note that, visually, the NA and MA data types are indistinguable: they both appear as a series of numeric components. They are distinguished by context, particularly when used in OBX.5 where the data type is specified in OBX.3. Use Case: Commercial EEG instruments Example 1: 3 channels (identical), 6 time-samples |0^0^0~1^1^1~2^2^2~3^3^3~4^4^4~5^5^5| Example 2: 1 channel, 11 time-samples |0~1~2~3~4~5~6~7~8~9~10|",

This important information, together with the information in OBR-29 - Parent, uniquely identifies the parent result’s OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result that identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs.

This data type provides a way to define repeat pattern codes \"on the fly\". The repeat pattern code is equivalent to the TQ data type, component 2, subcomponent 1 (repeat pattern). The additional components define the meaning of the repeat pattern code. Components 2 - 10 are used to define relatively simple repeat patterns. Component 11 is provided to define complex repeat patterns. This data type forms a bridge between the 2.x Repeat Pattern concept from Quantity/Timing, and the Version 3.0 GTS General Timing Specification. Component 1 is the 2.x concept of repeat pattern. Components 2-7 are derived from the version 3.0 data type PIVL. Components 8-10 are derived from the version 3.0 EIVL data type. If a repeat pattern cannot be defined using components 2-10, then component 11, General Timing Specification is provided. This allows the full literal form of the version 3.0 GTS to be specified. When using the RPT, if an application doesn't recognize the code in component 1, then it may attempt to determine the appropriate frequency using the remaining components. If the application does recognize the code in component 1, the application is not required to determine the frequency from the remaining components. Use Case: The use case supporting this proposal is the need to define repeat patterns on the fly while placing an order. The TQ data type did not have the capability to define the meaning of a repeat pattern on the fly. To get around this problem, vendors have implemented a variety of solutions to solve this issue. One way was to add Z-components to the TQ data type to transmit information about the repeat pattern. Another solution was to attempt to parse the repeat pattern code in an attempt to decipher what the code meant.",

    "description": "The switching between the different character sets can be accomplished using a character set such as JIS X 0202 - ISO 2022 which provides an escape sequence for switching among different character sets and among single-byte and multi-byte character representations. When the name field is repeated, the different repetitions of the name may be represented by these different character sets. The details are as follows. (See also Section 2.9.2, “Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets for PN, XPN, XCN, XON, XAD, FT, ST and TX data types.”) HL7 supports the following standards for Japanese characters: JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 13 (Japanese Katakana) JIS X 0201 for ISO-IR 14 (Japanese Romaji) JIS X 0208 for ISO-IR 87 (Japanese Kanji, Hiragana and Katakana) JIS X 0212 for ISO-IR 159 (supplementary Japanese Kanji) HL7 supports the following standards for European characters: ISO 8859 (1-9) for ISO-IR 100, 101, 109, 110, 144,127, 126, 138 and 148. Character sets are referenced in HL7 as ASCII, 8859/1,8859/2, ISO IR14, ISO IR87, and ISO IR159. DICOM uses codes laid out in ISO 2375, of the form 'ISO-IR xxx'. HL7 supports this naming as well, to facilitate interoperability. HL7 uses the Basic G0 Set of the International Reference Version of ISO 646:1990 (ISO IR-6) as the default character repertoire for character strings. This is a single-byte character set, identical to ASCII. Each repetition of a XPN, XON, XCN, or XAD field is assumed to begin with the default character set. If another character set is to be used, the HL7 defined escape sequence used to announce that character set must be at the beginning of the repetition, and the HL7 defined escape sequence used to start the default character set must be at the end of the repetition. Note also that several character sets may be intermixed within a single repetition as long as the repetition ends with a return to the default character set. An application must specify which character sets it supports in the field MSH-18 Character Sets and which character set handling scheme it supports in the field MSH-20 Alternate Character Set Handling Scheme. It is assumed that the sending and receiving applications are aware of how to map character set names (i.e., ISO-IR xxx) to escape sequences. For example, in many Japanese messages there is a mix of Romaji (i.e., Roman characters), Katakana (phonetic representation of foreign words), Hiragana (phonetic representation of Japanese words) and Kanji (pictographs). Such a message would require 4 character sets be specified in the MSH.
