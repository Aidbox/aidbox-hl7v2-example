The first component contains the earliest date and time that the appointment may be scheduled to begin. The second component contains the latest date and time that the appointment may be scheduled to begin. The DTM (time stamp) data type allows for two components: the time stamp, and a degree of precision. If used, the degree of precision should be separated from the time stamp by a subcomponent delimiter. If only the range start date/time has been provided, then the range end date/time is assumed to be infinity. Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the next available slot on/after a particular date and time. If only the range end date/time has been provided, then the range start date/time is assumed to be immediate. Using this scenario is equivalent to requesting the appointment start some time between the current date and time, and the specified range end date/time. Requesting an appointment when the range start and range end date/time are the same is equivalent to requesting a specific slot on a schedule. If this field is unvalued, then the filler application will September 2015 assume that the next available slot should be scheduled, using the institution's processing rules for scheduling appointments. This field may repeat. Repetitions of this field are used to construct a list of acceptable ranges. Repetitions of this field are connected with a logical OR to construct this list. This procedure allows applications to provide multiple preferences for the scheduling of appointments. Applications should take steps to ensure that nonsensical ranges are not indicated in this field (for example, redundant ranges)."

Coding systems may be developed for this field or applications may use facility-wide or standardized orders and procedures coding systems. This enables integration of procedures or events ordered for clinical trials with medical order entry systems. 8.12 8.12.1 INVENTORY ITEM MASTER FILES MFN/MFK - Inventory Item Master File Message (Event M15) This section is concerned with describing a master file message that should be used to communicate information that relates to the inventory of items that can be used to perform an ordered service. While an order specifies a service that is represented in an Other Observation/Service Item master file, this message is concerned with communicating attributes of those orderable items (for example lot number and expiration date) that are represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file. These attributes are more granular than can be represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file as there may be multiple items in inventory that meet the characteristics of the Service Item but have different specific characteristics, e.g., multiple lots of a vaccine. Each MFE/IIM structure describes a specific set of lot, expiration date, location, etc. for a Service Item. Multiple instances of MFE/IIM could be used to describe the same Service Item lot at multiple locations, or a location with multiple lots of the same Service Item. September 2015 This message is not intended to act as a complete inventory management system. Various inventory management concepts, e.g., PAR levels, invoice and purchase order tracking, are intentionally not supported. The message is intended to synchronize limited orderable item attributes, e.g., quantity on hand, lot number, expiration date, between communicating systems. Such systems may include a Pharmacy Application and a Nurse-based dispensing system. While the Pharmacy application may define the service items (communicated in [MFN^M12^MFN_12] Other Observation/Service Item master file Messages), the dispensing system would communicate the lot numbers, expiration date and quantity on hand for service items in inventory using the Inventory Item Master file message. Note: The IIM segment has been moved to Chapter 17.

The synchronization of the \"item master\" between systems and across the enterprise enables the success of the subsequent interfacing of transactions such as: material item requisitions (pre and post case), accounts payable invoices for the payment of material items, journal entries generated from the issue of items to departments or other inventory locations, and patient charges that allow a customer to improve patient care through the better management of materials. To face budget challenges, healthcare organizations need materials management systems that integrate with finance to automate logistics, eliminate paperwork and analyze data to improve September 2015 efficiency and reduce overall costs."

The events are presented in the order in which they would occur in a typical patient encounter. The first event to occur when the patient visits the medical practice is the verification of eligibility/coverage information. Next, the patient will be diagnosed and may be referred to a specialist for further treatment. This procedure may require a request for pre-authorization from the payor, which will be forwarded to the referral provider. Once the referral provider begins treatment, messages regarding the status or outcome of the treatment will be sent to the referring provider. Queries may also be sent to the specialist and reference laboratories. 11.9.1 RQI Message Using an I01 Event with an Immediate Response When a patient arrives for an appointment, the office staff will frequently need to verify the patient's insurance information. In the following RQI message example, Dr. Hippocrates is sending an insurance information request to the H. C. Payor Insurance Company for his patient, Adam A. Everyman. The response from the payor is shown in a more complete IN1 segment. However, it should be noted that in addition to the IN1 segment, this return information could have been placed in the NTE segment to serve as display data. This strategy would serve a broader community of diverse application systems that might have different levels of ability to process the record-formatted data."

    "description": "A workflow-management IDIS generated number that identifies the Filler Order for an Imaging Service (Imaging Service Request). This identifier corresponds one-to-one to the Order Filler number but is used in internal tracking of the work by the IDIS and in communication between IDIS within the department. It also has specific requirements to assure its compatibility with DICOM. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies the Imaging Service Request. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0008,0050) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field. An IDIS that performs functions of the workflow management for a department may accept a single Placer Order that gives rise to one or more Filler Orders-Imaging Service Requests. For example, an IDIS may receive an order for an X-ray examination of the patient daily at 8 am for the next three days. For the purposes of fulfilling the Placer Order, it will identify each of the daily exams either as a separate Filler Order or parts of a single Filler Order. Correspondingly, it will assign one or more Filler Order numbers associated with the order. For each of the Filler Order numbers, it will assign a unique Accession Number. Each of the Imaging Service Requests may contain one or more Requested Procedures that it will identify with the Requested Procedure ID. The Requested Procedure is the most granular unit of work that may lead to the creation of the procedure report. Each procedure report contributes to the results for the order. In the example mentioned above, each of the daily examinations will require a separate diagnostic report, hence each of them will be treated as a separate Requested Procedure. Depending on the treatment of the order by the IDIS, it will either link all Requested Procedures to a single Filler Order-Imaging Service Request, or link each Requested Procedure to its own Imaging Service Request. Exact type of requested procedure is conveyed by the coded values in OBR-44 Procedure Code and OBR-45 Procedure Code modifier for each procedure. Note that in case of multiple Requested Procedures corresponding to one order, each procedure may have different code. To support communication with the instances of equipment in a department (acquisition modalities), IDIS will also generate the Study Instance UID, a globally unique identifier for each Requested Procedure. This identifier will be used by acquisition modalities to identify all generated images and other DICOM objects related to this Requested Procedure. Note that, unlike the Study Instance UID, the Requested Procedure ID must only be unique within the scope of the encompassing Imaging Service Request identified by an Accession Number. Each of the Requested Procedures may be further broken down by the IDIS into the Scheduled Procedure Steps based on the timing and equipment requirements. Each step is identified with the Scheduled Procedure Step ID. A single Procedure Step may only be performed on a single type and instance of the equipment. Thus, while the Requested Procedure may identify multi-modality examination (such as ones common in Nuclear Medicine), a single Procedure Step shall correspond to the operations performed on a single modality. The example of the hierarchy of Imaging Service Request, Requested Procedure and Scheduled Procedure Step is depicted in a figure 4-6. Identifiers of the entities are represented by the field names stated in square brackets. Figure 4-6."

It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies the Procedure Step. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. This string must uniquely identify the Procedure Step within the scope of the Requested Procedure. This uniqueness must persist over time. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0040,0009) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field. The second through fourth components contain the ID of the workflow management IDIS, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, \"HD - hierarchic designator\"). The second component is a userdefined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of five (5) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the Requested Procedure number always identifies the actual filler of an order. A Procedure Step is an arbitrarily defined scheduled unit of service, which is specified by the Procedure Plan for a Requested Procedure. A Procedure Step prescribes Protocol that may be identified by one or more protocol codes. A Procedure Step involves equipment (e.g., imaging Modality equipment, anesthesia equipment, surgical equipment, transportation equipment), human resources, consumable supplies, location, and time (e.g., start time, stop time, duration). While in the context of Imaging Service request the scheduling of a Procedure Step might include only a general designation of imaging Modality that could be satisfied by multiple pieces of the same equipment type, the performance of one instance of a Procedure Step involves one and only one piece of imaging Modality equipment."

For example, if there are 3 low priority messages, 1 medium priority message and 1 high priority message, the message waiting priority would be 'high', because that is the highest priority of any message waiting. With some applications, there is no guarantee that the sending application will be running. The receiving application is therefore unable to submit unsolicited messages. To mitigate this, a polling approach is used where the receiving application requests any queued messages when it is connected. To avoid the network overhead of continuous polling, the sending application needs a way to indicate that there are queued messages awaiting retrieval. It is also useful to provide an indication of the importance of those messages to indicate how quickly they should be retrieved.

An HL7 message uses field MSH-18 Character Set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate Character Sets. MSH-18 Character Set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII. More than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 SHALL indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used. The repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.3, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\". Any encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18 Character Set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message. By using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system. 4 Available from ISO 1 Rue de Varembe, Case Postale 56, CH 1211, Geneve, Switzerland Note: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed. a) if the field is not valued, the default single-byte character set (ASCII (\"ISO IR6\")) should be assumed. No other character sets are allowed in the message. b) if the field repeats, but the first element is NULL (i.e., present but unvalued), the single-byte ASCII (\"ISO IR6\") is assumed as the default character set. c) elements in the remainder of the sequence (i.e., elements 2..n) are alternate character sets that may be used.

The Business Organization represents the legal entity responsible for the contents of the message. Use Case #1: A centralized system responsible for recording and monitoring instances of communicable diseases enforces a stringent authentication protocol with external applications that have been certified to access its information base. In order to allow message exchange, the centralized system mandates that external applications must provide the identity of the business organization sending the message (Sending Responsible Organization), the organization it is sending the message to (Receiving Responsible Organization, in this case the \"owner\" of the communicable diseases system), the network address from which the message has originated (Sending Network Address), the network address the message is being transmitted to (Receiving Network Address).

This field should only be populated when the underlying communication protocol does not support identification of sending network locations. An agreement about the specific values and usage must exist among messaging partners. Use Case: Dr. Hippocrates works for the ''Good Health Clinic\" (Sending facility) with a laptop running application XYZ (Sending App). He needs to talk to the provincial pharmacy system. He dials in and is assigned a network address. He then sends a message to the pharmacy system, which transmits a response back to him. Because the underlying network protocol does not have a place to communicate the sender and receiver network addresses, it therefore requires these addresses to be present in a known position in the payload. There may be many doctors running application XYZ. In addition, the network address assigned to the laptop may change with each dial-in.

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (section 2.A.36, \"HD – Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters. See ORC-2-placer order number (section 4.5.1.2) for information on when this field must be valued. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since thirdparty applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment). The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id. From that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a \"Send Number\" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id. If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated. These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers)."

It is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (see Chapter 2, section 2.A.28, \"EI – entity identifier\"). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filling (receiving) application. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time. The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, \"HD – hierarchic designator\"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order. See ORC-3-filler order number for information on when this field must be valued.

It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated. The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application. Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to \"CA\" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself."

This important information, together with the information in OBR-29-Parent Result Obersvation Identifier and OBR-54 Parent Order, uniquely identifies the parent result's OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports, or the specific result for which this order or observation is a reflex. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. In the case of a reflex order, if it is necessary to point to the specific result value for which it is in response, OBR-26 enables pointing to that specific OBX segment. The third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture. We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs. This field is present only when the parent result is identified by OBR-29- Result Observation Identifier or OBR-54, Parent Order, and the parent spawns child orders or results for each of many results. (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.) A second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX). If more than one organism is present, OBX-4-observation sub-ID is used to distinguish them. In this case, the first OBX with subID N will contain a value identifying the Nth microorganism, and each additional OBX with subID N will contain susceptibility values for a given antimicrobial test on this organism. 4.5.3.27 OBR-27 Quantity/timing Attention: The OBR-27 element was retained for backward compatibilty only as of v 2.5 and the detail was withdrawn and removed from the standard as of v 2.7."

As of v 2.7, the ST data type may not be used to transmit data that can be more precisely transmitted using other data types, e.g. SN when comparative symbols are needed. CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units. SI is invalid because it only applies to HL7 message segments; ID is also invalid because it requires a constant field definition. The RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the OBX-5 contains a pointer to the data e.g., a URL of an image. The receiving system can use this reference pointer whenever it needs access to the actual data through other interface standards, e.g., DICOM, or through appropriate data base servers. The structured numeric (SN) data type provides for reporting ranges (e.g., 3-5 or 10-20), titres (e.g., 1:10), and out-of-range indicators (e.g., >50) in a structured and computer-interpretable way. We allow the FT data type in the OBX segment, but its use is discouraged. Formatted text usually implies a meaningful structure, e.g., a list of three independent diagnoses reported on different lines. But ideally, the structure in three independent diagnostic statements would be reported as three separate OBX segments. TX should not be used except to send large amounts of text.

In most systems the identifier will point to a master observation table that will provide other attributes of the observation that may be used by the receiving system to process the observations it receives. A set of message segments for transmitting such master observation tables is described in Chapter 8. The relation of an observation ID to a master observation table is analogous to the relationship between a charge code (in a billing record) and the charge master. When local codes are used as the first identifier in this field we strongly encourage sending a universal identifier as well to permit receivers to equivalence results from different providers of the same service (e.g., a hospital lab and commercial lab that provides serum potassium to a nursing home). LOINC® is one possible universal and HL7-approved code system for the Observation identifier. It covers observations September 2015 and measurements, such as laboratory tests, physical findings, radiology studies, and claims attachments. See HL7 Table 0396 – Coding System, the HL7 www list server and Appendix X2 of ASTM E1467 for neurophysiology tests, or it can be obtained from www.regenstrief.org/loinc/loinc.htm.

    "description": "This field is used to distinguish between multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID organized under one OBR. Starting with V2.8.2 the data type was changed from ST to OG to enable improved structured grouping of observation segments. In this enhanced mode, the first component provides backwards compatibility with existing grouping schemes, while the additional components can be used for improved structures as defined in specific conformance profiles. For example, a chest X-ray report might include three separate diagnostic impressions. The standard requires three OBX segments, one for each impression. By putting a 1 in the Sub-ID of the first of these OBX segments, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, we can uniquely identify each OBX segment for editing or replacement. The sub-identifier is also used to group related components in reports such as surgical pathology. It is traditional for surgical pathology reports to include all the tissues taken from one surgical procedure in one report. Consider, for example, a single surgical pathology report that describes the examination of gallbladder and appendix tissue. This report would be transmitted roughly as shown in Figure 7-2.

Thus, there are two 88304&ANT segments; there are two \"22634-0^Path report.gross observation^LN\" segments, and there are two \"22635-7^Path report.microscopic observation^LN\" segments. Segments that apply to the gallbladder all have the sub-identifier 1. Segments that apply to the appendix all have sub-identifier 2. The observation sub ID has other grouping uses. It can be used to organize the reporting of some kinds of fluid intakes and outputs. For example, when intake occurs through multiple intravenous lines, a number of separate observations (OBX segments), the intake volume, the type of intake (Blood, D5W, Plasma, etc.), the site of the IV line, etc. may be needed for each intravenous line, each requiring a separate OBX segment. If more than one IV line is running, we can logically link all of the OBX segments that pertain to the first IV line by assigning them an observation sub ID of 1. We can do the same with the second IV line by assigning them a sub ID 2 and so on. The same would apply to the outputs of surgical drains when there are multiple such drains. The use of the sub ID to distinguish repeating OBXs for the same observation ID is really a special case of using the sub ID to group, as can be seen if we picture the OBX segments in Figure 7-2 as part of a table September 2015 where the rows correspond to a particular species of observation and the cells correspond to the sub ID numbers that would be associated with each corresponding OBX."

It is not a required field because some systems will report only the Interpretation Codes (OBX-8), especially in product experience reporting. The length of the observation field is variable, depending upon OBX-2-value type. This field may repeat for multipart, single answer results. Representation This field contains the value related to the OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as SNOMED), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text. Reporting logically independent observations The main sections of dictated reports, such as radiologic studies or history and physicals, are reported as separate OBX segments. In addition, each logically independent observation should be reported in a separate OBX segment, i.e., one OBX segment should not contain the result of more than one logically independent observation, unless it is part of a list of like concepts that belong together (e.g., a list of conditions tested for in newborn screening or mutations looked for in genomic testing). This requirement is included to assure that the contents of OBX-6-units, OBX-8-interpretation codes, and OBX-9-probability can be interpreted unambiguously. This means that all other OBX field values apply equally to the whole of OBX-5 noting that OBX-6 does not apply in the case of coded values. The electrolytes and vital signs batteries, for example, would each be reported as four separate OBX segments. Two diagnostic impressions, e.g., congestive heart failure and pneumonia, would also be reported as two separate OBX segments whether reported as part of a discharge summary or chest X-ray report. Similarly, two bacterial organisms isolated in a single bacterial culture would be reported as two separate OBX segments. Though two independent diagnostic statements cannot be reported in one OBX segment, unless they represent elements of a single list to which all other OBX field values apply equally, multiple categorical responses are allowed (usually as CWE data types separated by repeat delimiters), so long as they are fragments (modifiers) that together construct one diagnostic statement. Right upper lobe (recorded as one code) and pneumonia (recorded as another code), for example, could be both reported in one OBX segment. Such multiple \"values\" would be separated by repeat delimiters. The other example where use of repeat delimiters is allowed for coded values would be a list of conditions or mutations tested for to provide reference for the test results reported in related, but independent OBX segments. Multiple answers to a single question (for example mark all that apply type questions) could also be handled using this approach. It is important to state that ANY independent observation, that may require parent-child linking to additional tests, such as reflex testing, SHALL NOT be included in a single OBX-5 field using repeat delimiters, nor any list elements that require variations in the values of other OBX field values."

This field reflects the current completion status of the results for one Observation Identifier. It is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of \"F.\" Code F indicates that the result has been verified to be correct and final. Code W indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code C indicates that data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code D indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through September 2015 intermediate (e.g., 'gram positive cocci') to final (e.g., 'staphylococcus aureus') should not be transmitted as C (correction); they should be transmitted as P (depending upon the specific case) until they are final. If an observation involves multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID, the observation result status applies to all OBX segments, except where the value is D or X. The value of D or X is applicable only to the individual OBX. All other OBX segments with the same Observation ID and observation sub-ID must have the same value. In the case of coding systems such as LOINC, the preceding rules typically mean that this field applies to a single OBX segment. There are situations where the observation battery required for the order needs to be dynamically specified at the time of ordering. That is, this battery is then defined by the set of OBX segments transmitted along with the order and generated by the placing system. For example, timed measurements of serum glucose challenge tests may vary among laboratories. One institution may report them at –30, -15, 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while another may report them at –30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Master file entries may exist for each individual element of the battery but not for the battery itself. Another example may be Renin Studies where the specification may be done upon ordering without having a master file definition for each permutation of the possible element. The OBX segments in the ORM message can be used to create dynamic specifications to accommodate these permutations without defining pre-existing master file definitions for the battery itself. The result status field in the OBX can be used to indicate whether the OBX in the ORM message is used to provide a dynamic specification or is used to communicate a result as context to the order. The status of O shall be used to indicate that the OBX segment is used for a dynamic specification of the required result. An OBX used for a dynamic specification must contain the detailed examination code, units, etc., with OBX-11 valued with O, and OBX-2 and OBX-5 valued with null."

An example is an antimicrobial susceptibility result. Some systems prefer to display only the susceptibility results of inexpensive antimicrobials depending upon the organism, the source of the specimen and the patient's allergy status. The sending service wants to send all of the susceptibilities so that certain privileged users (e.g., Infectious Disease specialists) can review all of the results but non-privileged users would see only the \"preferred\" antimicrobials to which the organism was susceptible.

The same code in an RDS message, cancels the dispense. Very detailed explanatory notes are given at the end of this section. This field may be considered the \"trigger event\" identifier for orders. The codes fall roughly into the following three categories: a) event request – Codes like \"NW\" (new order) and \"CA\" (cancel order request) are used to initiate an event . b) event acknowledgment – Codes like \"OK\" (order accepted) and \"CR\" (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request . c) event notification – Codes like \"OC\" (order canceled) and \"OD\" (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred. No application reply is necessary. Event request codes are intended to initiate an event. Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event. Event notification codes are intended to notify another application that, e.g., the filler has performed some action on an order that the other application, e.g., the placer, needs to know. Fillers, placers, and other applications can use event requests, event acknowledgments, and event – notification-type trigger events interchangeably. However, certain order control codes can originate only from the filler (e.g., CR) and others can only originate from the placer (e.g., CA).

    "description": "This field is the placer application's order number. This field is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (See Section 2.A.28, \"EI – Entity Identifier\"). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, \"HD – Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters. There are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique): a) in ORC-1-order control value of RO, following an RU replacement; b) in ORC-1-order control value of CH (child orders); and c) in ORC-1-order control value of SN (send number). See the Table Notes under ORC-1-order control for the details of how the ORC-2-placer order number is assigned in these cases. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment). The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id. From that perspective each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a \"Send Number\" control code since its purpose is to request a placer id. If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). Note that if both ORC-2 and OBR-2 are valued then they must be valued the same; as well, if both ORC-3 and OBR-3 are valued, then they must be valued the same. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated. These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers)."

    "description": "This field is the order number associated with the filling application. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (Section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies an order detail segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filler (receiving) application. This string must uniquely identify the order (as specified in the order detail segment) from other orders in a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time. The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see Section 2.A.36, \"HD – hierarchic designator\"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since thirdparty applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the filler application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment). The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.

It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number for the placer order number when a new order is placed or a unique number for the filler order number when an unsolicited result is initially communicated. The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application. Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to \"CA\" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself."

Fields occur in the position order defined for the query or table (unless overridden by an optional RDF segment on a stored procedure request or Virtual Table query message), separated by field delimiters. 5.6 AUXILIARY QUERY PROTOCOLS This section discusses properties of queries that can be described as global properties. These properties enable the Client and Server to deal with timing and sizing issues and to handle exceptions. 5.6.1 Immediate vs. deferred response Responses to queries can be either immediate or deferred. In the immediate mode, the responding process gives the response immediately or in a short period during which the requesting process will wait for the response. In the deferred mode, the response is returned asynchronously, as a separate message pair. Also, a time interval for the deferred transaction may be specified. In the case of immediate mode query, the Server does NOT send a General Acknowledgement (ACK). The acknowledgement of the query is contained within the response message. In the case of deferred mode, the query is acknowledged immediately by an ACK. The Server sends the deferred response at the appropriate time. The Client acknowledges the response with an ACK. In short, the deferred query transaction consists of 2 \"round trips.\" If an immediate mode query message is malformed, a negative ACK is immediately sent. September 2015 Use cases for Deferred Response include: 1) evaluate the query conditions at a certain point in time and then return the response. For example, \"At 9 AM tomorrow, evaluate query and return response\"; 2) produce a large report to be communicated to the Server at an off-peak hour. For example, a response which contains all admissions records for the month to be sent at 4:00 a.m., or a reference lab results listing to be sent at noon. A deferred response can benefit both Server and Client in such cases, especially where the generation, communication, and receipt of segments can all be done at times of otherwise low-volume processing. If the Query Profile indicates that the Server will support both immediate and deferred responses, then the Client may indicate the desired value of this property by sending it in the RCP-1 Response priority field. If the Server supports only one response type, then the value specified by the Client SHALL agree. Immediate Query Query (2 PM) Server Client Response (2:01 PM) Deferred Query"

For example, if a custom dermatologic salve is being prepared, the \"B\" item might be a standard base ointment into which other components are mixed. The amount of the \"base\" specified in the \"B\" segment(s) is defined to be the quantity into which amounts specified in the \"A\" components are mixed. Thus the RXC segments as a group define the \"recipe\" for a particular amount (defined by the base segment(s)). The give amount, as defined in the RXO, does not need to correspond to this base amount. For example, the RXC segments may specify a recipe for a liter of a standard type of saline with 1 gram of a particular antimicrobial, while the give amount (from the RXO) may specify the administration of 2 liters of this IV-solution every 24 hours. The amount specified in each \"A\" segment is defined to be the quantity to be added to the amount of the base as specified in its RXC segment. If any \"base\" components are present then these should be transmitted first. The first \"base\" component in the transmission should be considered the \"primary base\" if such a distinction is necessary.

In the RXE segment, this give code must be fully encoded. The dispense fields, which define the units and amount of what is to be issued to the patient (see RXE10-dispense amount and RXE-11-dispense units below) do not necessarily correlate with the instructions of what amount is to be \"given\" or administered with each dose, and may or may not be specified with the order. For example, the \"give\" part of the order may convey the fieldrepresentation of give 250 mg of Ampicillin, while the request to dispense part of the order may convey issue 30 tablets of generic equivalent for this outpatient prescription. The coding system used is conditional on both the nature of the medical substance or treatment ordered and site-specific implementation considerations. For vaccines, HL7 Table 0292 – Vaccines Administered is the preferred coding system. For non-vaccine products, the coding system may be a local implementation of User-defined Table 0479 – Pharmaceutical Substances or an external coding system. Examples of external coding systems include, but are not limited to, National Drug Codes (NDC), Medispan Generic Product Identifier (MGPI), Drug Descriptor Identifier (DDID), and other drug codes listed in HL7 Table 0396 – Coding Systems. The following examples illustrate some code tables other than User-defined Table 0479: NDC: 0006915404^Norvasc 10mg Tabs^NDC DDID: 015189^Norvasc 10mg Tabs^DDID CVX (HL70292): 30^HBIG^CVX 4A.4.4.3"

An inpatient order might be NS/D5W (normal saline with 5% dextrose) at 1000cc/hour—dispense 3 1-liter bottles of NSD5W solution. The request-to-dispense fields support this common style of ordering. 4A.4.1.11 RXO-11 Requested Dispense Amount (NM) 00302 This field specifies the amount to be dispensed. See above note. 4A.4.1.12 RXO-12 Requested Dispense Units (CWE) 00303 Alternate Coding System (ID)> ^ <Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ Coding System Version ID (ST)> ^ <Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> ^ <Second Alternate Coding System OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set OID (ST)> ^ <Second Alternate Value Set Version ID (DTM)> This field identifies the units for the dispense amount. This must be in simple units that reflect the actual quantity of the substance to be dispensed. It does not include compound units. See above note. 4A.4.1.13 RXO-13 Number of Refills (NM) 00304 This field defines the number of times the requested dispense amount can be given to the patient, subject to local regulation.

The container states are relevant for the exchange of information among devices (within the LAS). Not all of them are relevant for information transfer between the LAS and the LIS. In the explanations below the system means the LAS or any equipment interfaced to it or to another piece of equipment. Identified status is used by one system to inform another that it has received a container. In the exchange between the LAS and LIS the Identified status can be used for reporting of the \"In Lab\" (Specimen Received) status. In some cases this may not be equal to the first event of sample recognition. In Position status is used by one system to inform another that the container is in position for specimen transfer (e.g., container removal from track, pipetting, etc.). In Process status is used by one system to inform another that the specific container is being processed by the equipment. It is useful as a response to a query about Container Status, when the specific step of the process is not relevant. Process Completed status is used by one system to inform another that the processing has been completed, but the container has not been released from that system. Left Equipment status is used by one system to inform another that the container has been released from that system. Missing status is used by one system to inform another that the container did not arrive at its next expected location. Cancelled status is used by one system to inform another that the container is no longer available within the scope of the system (e.g., tube broken or discarded). Unknown status is used by one system to inform another that the container has not been identified. September 2015"
