The first component of this field is a string of up to 15 characters that identifies an individual authorization. It is assigned by the coverage application, and it identifies an authorization, and the subsequent billing transactions resulting from the given authorization, uniquely among all such authorizations granted from a particular processing application. The second component is optional because this field, itself, is already defined as an authorization identifier. The third component is optional. If used it should contain the application identifier for the coverage application. The application identifier is a string of up to six characters that is uniquely associated with an application. A given healthcare provider facility, or group of intercommunicating healthcare provider facilities, should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential originators and recipients, and then assign unique application identifiers to each of those applications. This list of application identifiers becomes one of the healthcare provider facility’s master dictionary lists. Since applications fulfilling different application roles can send and receive referral messages containing authorizations, the coverage application identifier may not identify the application sending or receiving a particular message.

While an order specifies a service that is represented in an Other Observation/Service Item master file, this message is concerned with communicating attributes of those orderable items (for example lot number and expiration date) that are represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file. These attributes are more granular than can be represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file as there may be multiple items in inventory that meet the characteristics of the Service Item but have different specific characteristics, e.g., multiple lots of a vaccine. Each MFE/IIM structure describes a specific set of lot, expiration date, location, etc. for a Service Item. Multiple instances of MFE/IIM could be used to describe the same Service Item lot at multiple locations, or a location with multiple lots of the same Service Item. This message is not intended to act as a complete inventory management system. Various inventory management concepts, e.g., PAR levels, invoice and purchase order tracking, are intentionally not supported. The message is intended to synchronize limited orderable item attributes, e.g., quantity on hand, lot number, expiration date, between communicating systems. Such systems may include a Pharmacy Application and a Nurse-based dispensing system. While the Pharmacy application may define the service items (communicated in [MFN^M12^MFN_12] Other Observation/Service Item master file Messages), the dispensing system would communicate the lot numbers, expiration date and quantity on hand for service items in inventory using the Inventory Item Master file message. Note: We recognize that the M15 Inventory Item Master File trigger event and the IIM inventory item master segment is a limited implementation. There is a comprehensive Materials Management message in development for inclusion in the next release. For further information contact the Scheduling and Logistics TC. This will be coordinated with the Control/Query TC and the Orders and Observations TC.

The events are presented in the order in which they would occur in a typical patient encounter. The first event to occur when the patient visits the medical practice is the verification of eligibility/coverage information. Next, the patient will be diagnosed and may be referred to a specialist for further treatment. This procedure may require a request for pre-authorization from the payor, which will be forwarded to the referral provider. Once the referral provider begins treatment, messages regarding the status or outcome of the treatment will be sent to the referring provider. Queries may also be sent to the specialist and reference laboratories. 11.7.1 RQI Message Using an I01 Event With an Immediate Response When a patient arrives for an appointment, the office staff will frequently need to verify the patient’s insurance information. In the following RQI message example, Dr. Blake is sending an insurance information request to the Washington State Insurance Company for her patient, Cary Joe Brown. The response from the payor is shown in a more complete IN1 segment. However, it should be noted that in addition to the IN1 segment, this return information could have been placed in the NTE segment to serve as display data. This strategy would serve a broader community of diverse application systems that might have different levels of ability to process the record-formatted data.

Knowledge of the logical break points in the display data can be useful to the application system that is displaying or printing data. For this reason, DSP-4-Logical break point is used. The sending application (the one that formats the data) places the logical break points where appropriate. If there is a particular ancillary result ID associated with the data delineated by DSP-4-Logical break point, the value of this ID also can be returned in DSP-5Result ID.

The ancillary response will contain the report referenced by this result ID (e.g., accession number).

    "description": "A workflow-management IDIS generated number that identifies the Filler Order for an Imaging Service (Imaging Service Request). This identifier corresponds one-to-one to the Order Filler number but is used in internal tracking of the work by the IDIS and in communication between IDIS within the department. It also has specific requirements to assure its compatibility with DICOM. It is a case of the Entity Identifier data type (Section 2.A.28). Its first component is a string that identifies the Imaging Service Request. A limit of sixteen (16) characters is required to allow compatibility with DICOM. See DICOM Standard Part 3 for further details on DICOM Attribute (0008,0050) that conveys information identical to the component one of this field. An IDIS that performs functions of the workflow management for a department may accept a single Placer Order that gives rise to one or more Filler Orders-Imaging Service Requests. For example, an IDIS may receive an order for an X-ray examination of the patient daily at 8 am for the next three days. For the purposes of fulfilling the Placer Order, it will identify each of the daily exams either as a separate Filler Order or parts of a single Filler Order. Correspondingly, it will assign one or more Filler Order numbers associated with the order. For each of the Filler Order numbers, it will assign a unique Accession Number. Each of the Imaging Service Requests may contain one or more Requested Procedures that it will identify with the Requested Procedure ID. The Requested Procedure is the most granular unit of work that may lead to the creation of the procedure report. Each procedure report contributes to the results for the order. In the example mentioned above, each of the daily examinations will require a separate diagnostic report, hence each of them will be treated as a separate Requested Procedure. Depending on the treatment of the order by the IDIS, it will either link all Requested Procedures to a single Filler Order-Imaging Service Request, or link each Requested Procedure to its own Imaging Service Request. Exact type of requested procedure is conveyed by the coded values in OBR-44 Procedure Code and OBR-45 Procedure Code modifier for each procedure. Note that in case of multiple Requested Procedures corresponding to one order, each procedure may have different code. To support communication with the instances of equipment in a department (acquisition modalities), IDIS will also generate the Study Instance UID, a globally unique identifier for each Requested Procedure. This identifier will be used by acquisition modalities to identify all generated images and other DICOM objects related to this Requested Procedure. Note that, unlike the Study Instance UID, the Requested Procedure ID must only be unique within the scope of the encompassing Imaging Service Request identified by an Accession Number. Each of the Requested Procedures may be further broken down by the IDIS into the Scheduled Procedure Steps based on the timing and equipment requirements. Each step is identified with the Scheduled Procedure Step ID. A single Procedure Step may only be performed on a single type and instance of the equipment. Thus, while the Requested Procedure may identify multi-modality examination (such as ones common in Nuclear Medicine), a single Procedure Step shall correspond to the operations performed on a single modality. The example of the hierarchy of Imaging Service Request, Requested Procedure and Scheduled Procedure Step is depicted in a figure 4-6. Identifiers of the entities are represented by the field names stated in square brackets. Figure 4-6."

    "description": "This field contains the character set for the entire message. Refer to HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate character sets for valid values. An HL7 message uses field MSH-18-character set to specify the character set(s) in use. Valid values for this field are specified in HL7 Table 0211, \"Alternate Character Sets\". MSH-18-character set may be left blank, or may contain one or more values delimited by the repetition separator. If the field is left blank, the character set in use is understood to be the 7-bit ASCII set, decimal 0 through decimal 127 (hex 00 through hex 7F). This default value may also be explicitly specified as ASCII. More than one character set may be used in a message. The first occurrence, if supplied, of the MSH-18 must indicate the default encoding of the message. The second and subsequent occurrences of MSH-18character set are used to specify additional character sets that are used. The repetitions of this field to specify different character sets apply only to fields of the FT, ST and TX data types. See also section 2.7.2, \"Escape sequences supporting multiple character sets\". Any encoding system, single-byte or multi-byte, may be specified as the default character encoding in MSH-18-character set. If the default encoding is other than 7-bit ASCII, sites shall document this usage in the dynamic conformance profile or other implementation agreement. This is particularly effective in promoting interoperability between nations belonging to different HL7 Affiliates, while limiting the amount of testing required to determine the encoding of a message. By using built-in language functions for string and character manipulation, parsers and applications need not be concerned whether a single or double byte character set is in use, provided it is applied to the entire message. Using a built in function to extract the fourth CHARACTER will always yield the field separator character, regardless of coding set. On the other hand, if the parser looks at the fourth BYTE, it is then limited to single byte character sets, since the fourth byte would contain the low order 8 bits of the character S in a double-byte system. Note: When describing encoding rules, this standard always speaks in terms of character position, not byte offset. Similarly, comparisons should be done on character values, not their byte equivalents. For this reason, delimiter characters should always have representation in the standard 7-bit ASCII character set, regardless of the actual character set being used, so that a search for the character CR (carriage return) can be performed. 5 Available from ISO 1 Rue de Varembe, Case Postale 56, CH 1211, Geneve, Switzerland HL7 Table 0211 - Alternate character sets Value ASCII 8859/1 8859/2 8859/3 8859/4 8859/5 8859/6 8859/7 8859/8 8859/9 ISO IR14 ISO IR87 ISO IR159 GB 18030-2000 KS X 1001 CNS 11643-1992 BIG-5 UNICODE 6 Description The printable 7-bit ASCII character set.

This is the default, indicating that there is no character set switching occurring in this message. Comment This standard specifies an escape sequence from basic one byte character set to specified other character set, and vice versa. The escape sequence explicitly specifies what alternate character set to be evoked. Note that in this mode, the actual ASCII escape character is used as defined in the referenced ISO document. As noted in 1.7.1, escape sequences to/from alternate character set should occur within HL7 delimiters. In other words, HL7 delimiters are basic one byte characters only, and just before and just after delimiters, character encoding status should be the basic one byte set. Note that the escape sequences used in this mode do not use the ASCII \"esc\" character, as defined in ISO 2022-1994. They are \"HL7 escape sequences\" as first defined in HL7 2.3, sec. 2.9.2. (Also, note that sections 2.8.28.6.1and 2.9.2 in HL7 2.3 correspond to sections 2.16.93 and 2.7.2 in HL7 2. 5.) This is the default."

The first component is a string that identifies an individual order (e.g., OBR). A limit of fifteen (15) characters is suggested but not required. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, \"HD - Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters. See ORC-2-placer order number (Section 4.5.1.2) for information on when this field must be valued. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers of orders and assign each a unique application ID. The application ID list becomes one of the institution’s master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since thirdparty applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment). ORC-2-placer order number is the same as OBR-2-placer order number. If the placer order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR and vice versa. If both fields, ORC-2-placer order number and OBR-2-placer order number, are valued, they must contain the same value. When results are transmitted in an ORU message, an ORC is not required, and the identifying placer order number must be present in the OBR segments. These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers)."

    "description": "This field is the order number associated with the filling application. This is a permanent identifier for an order and its associated observations. It is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (see Chapter 2, Section 2.A.28, \"EI - entity identifier\"). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order segment (e.g., OBR). It is assigned by the order filling (receiving) application. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). ). This uniqueness must persist over time. The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see Section 2.A.36, \"HD - hierarchic designator\"). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order. See ORC-3-filler order number for information on when this field must be valued. OBR-3-filler order number is identical to ORC-3-filler order number. If the filler order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR. (This rule is the same for other identical fields in the ORC and OBR and promotes upward and ASTM compatibility.) This is particularly important when results are transmitted in an ORU message. In this case, the ORC is not required and the identifying filler order number must be present in the OBR segments. The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application. Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to “CA” and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself."

This important information, together with the information in OBR-29-parent, uniquely identifies the parent result's OBX segment related to this order. The value of this OBX segment in the parent result is the organism or chemical species about which this battery reports. For example, if the current battery is an antimicrobial susceptibility, the parent results identified OBX contains a result which identifies the organism on which the susceptibility was run. This indirect linkage is preferred because the name of the organism in the parent result may undergo several preliminary values prior to finalization. The third component may be used to record the name of the microorganism identified by the parent result directly. The organism in this case should be identified exactly as it is in the parent culture. We emphasize that this field does not take the entire result field from the parent. It is meant only for the text name of the organism or chemical subspecies identified. This field is included only to provide a method for linking back to the parent result for those systems that could not generate unambiguous Observation IDs and sub-IDs. This field is present only when the parent result is identified by OBR-29-parent and the parent spawns child orders for each of many results. (See Chapter 7 for more details about this linkage.) A second mode of conveying this information is to use a standard observation result segment (OBX). If more than one organism is present, OBX-4-observation sub-ID is used to distinguish them. In this case, the first OBX with subID N will contain a value identifying the Nth microorganism, and each additional OBX with subID N will contain susceptibility values for a given antimicrobial test on this organism."

The valid values for the value type of an observation are listed in HL7 Table 0125 - Value Type. The observation value must be represented according to the format for the data type defined in Chapter 2, Section 2.9, “Data Types.” For example, a PN consists of 6 components, separated by component delimiters. Although NM is a valid type, observations which are usually reported as numbers will sometimes have the string (ST) data type because non-numeric characters are often reported as part of the result, e.g., >300 to indicate the result was off-scale for the instrument. In the example, \">300\", \">\" is a symbol and the digits are considered a numeric value. However, this usage of the ST type should be discouraged since the SN (structured numeric) data type now accommodates such reporting and, in addition, permits the receiving system to interpret the magnitude. All HL7 data types are valid, and are included in Table 0125 except CM, CQ, SI, and ID. For a CM definition to have meaning, the specifics about the CM must be included in the field definition. OBX-5observation value is a general field definition that is influenced by the data type OBX-3, so CMs are undefined in this context. CQ is invalid because units for OBX-5-observation value are always specified explicitly in an OBX segment with OBX-6 units. SI is invalid because it only applied to HL7 message segments, and ID because it requires a constant field definition. The RP value (reference pointer) must be used if the actual observation value is not sent in OBX but exists somewhere else. For example, if the observation consists of an image (document or medical), the image itself cannot be sent in OBX. The sending system may in that case opt to send a reference pointer. The receiving system can use this reference pointer whenever it needs access to the actual image through other interface standards, e.g., DICOM, or through appropriate data base servers.

We allow the FT data type in the OBX segment but its use is discouraged. Formatted text usually implies a meaningful structure e.g., a list of three independent diagnoses reported on different lines. But ideally, the structure in three independent diagnostic statements would be reported as three separate OBX segments. TX should not be used except to send large amounts of text. In the TX data type, the repeat delimiter can only be used to identify paragraph breaks. Use ST to send short, and possibly encodable, text strings. CDA documents are to be exchanged in the OBX segment in any message that can exchange documents (such as MDM or ORU).

A set of message segments for transmitting such master observation tables is described in Chapter 8. The relation of an observation ID to a master observation table is analogous to the relationship between a charge code (in a billing record) and the charge master. When local codes are used as the first identifier in this field we strongly encourage sending a universal identifier as well to permit receivers to equivalence results from different providers of the same service (e.g., a hospital lab and commercial lab that provides serum potassium to a nursing home). LOINC® is an HL7 approved code system for the Observation identifier. It covers observations and measurements, such as laboratory tests, physical findings, radiology studies, and claims attachments and can be obtained from www.regenstrief.org/loinc/loinc.htm.

    "description": "This field is used to distinguish between multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID organized under one OBR. For example, a chest X-ray report might include three separate diagnostic impressions. The standard requires three OBX segments, one for each impression. By putting a 1 in the Sub-ID of the first of these OBX segments, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, we can uniquely identify each OBX segment for editing or replacement. The sub-identifier is also used to group related components in reports such as surgical pathology. It is traditional for surgical pathology reports to include all the tissues taken from one surgical procedure in one report. Consider, for example, a single surgical pathology report that describes the examination of gallbladder and appendix tissue. This report would be transmitted roughly as shown in Figure 7-2. Figure 7-2. Example of sub-identifier usage OBR|1||1234^LAB|88304&SURG PATH REPORT|...<cr> OBX|1|CE|88304&ANT|1|T57000^GALLBLADDER^SNM|...<cr> OBX|2|TX|88304&GDT|1|THIS IS A NORMAL GALLBLADDER|...<cr> OBX|3|TX|88304&MDT|1|MICROSCOPIC EXAM SHOWS HISTOLOGICALLY NORMAL GALLBLADDER TISSUE|...<cr> OBX|4|CE|88304&IMP|1|M-00100^NML^SNM|...<cr> OBX|5|CE|88304&ANT|2|T66000^APPENDIX^SNM|...<cr> OBX|6|TX|88304&GDT|2|THIS IS A RED, INFLAMED, SWOLLEN, BOGGY APPENDIX|...<cr> OBX|7|TX|88304&MDT|2|INFILTRATION WITH MANY PMN's - INDICATING INFLAMATORY CHANGE|...<cr> OBX|8|CE|88304&IMP|2|M-40000^INFLAMMATION NOS^SNM|...<cr> The example in Figure 7-2 has two segments for each component of the report, one for each of the two tissues. Thus, there are two 88304&ANT segments; there are two 88304&GDT segments, and there are two 88304&MDT segments. Segments that apply to the gallbladder all have the sub-identifier 1. Segments that apply to the appendix all have sub-identifier 2. The observation sub ID has other grouping uses. It can be used to organize the reporting of some kinds of fluid intakes and outputs. For example, when intake occurs through multiple intravenous lines, a number of separate observations (OBX segments), the intake volume, the type of intake (Blood, D5W, Plasma, etc.), the site of the IV line, etc. may be needed for each intravenous line, each requiring a separate OBX segment. If more than one IV line is running, we can logically link all of the OBX segments that pertain to the first IV line by assigning them an observation sub ID of 1. We can do the same with the second IV line by assigning them a sub ID 2 and so on. The same would apply to the outputs of surgical drains when there are multiple such drains. The use of the sub ID to distinguish repeating OBXs for the same observation ID is really a special case of using the sub ID to group, as can be seen if we picture the OBX segments in Figure 7-2 as part of a table where the rows correspond to a particular species of observation and the cells correspond to the sub ID numbers that would be associated with each corresponding OBX. Distinct Observations 88304&ANT 88304&GDT 80304&MDT 80304&IMP Sub ID 1st Group 1 1 1 1 Sub ID 2nd Group 2 2 2 2 The use of Sub IDs to group results is equivalent to defining a table, and the use of sub IDs to distinguish repeats is just a special case, represented by one column in this table. However, this approach introduces ambiguities if we have a set of repeating observations within a group, e.g., if the appendix observations include two impressions as in the 8th and 9th OBXs shown in Figure 7-3. This really represents the existence of a row nested within a single cell of the table given above. Figure 7-3."

It is not a required field because some systems will report only the normalcy/abnormalcy (OBX-8), especially in product experience reporting. The length of the observation field is variable, depending upon OBX-3-value type. This field may repeat for multipart, single answer results with appropriate data types, e.g., CE, TX, and FT data types. Representation This field contains the value of OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as SNOMED), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text. Reporting logically independent observations The main sections of dictated reports, such as radiologic studies or history and physicals, are reported as separate OBX segments. In addition, each logically independent observation should be reported in a separate OBX segment, i.e. one OBX segment should not contain the result of more than one logically independent observation. This requirement is included to assure that the contents of OBX-6-units, OBX-8abnormal flags, and OBX-9-probability can be interpreted unambiguously. The electrolytes and vital signs batteries, for example, would each be reported as four separate OBX segments. Two diagnostic impressions, e.g., congestive heart failure and pneumonia, would also be reported as two separate OBX segments whether reported as part of a discharge summary or chest X-ray report. Similarly, two bacterial organisms isolated in a single bacterial culture would be reported as two separate OBX segments. Though two independent diagnostic statements cannot be reported in one OBX segment, multiple categorical responses are allowed (usually as CE data types separated by repeat delimiters), so long as they are fragments (modifiers) that together construct one diagnostic statement. Right upper lobe (recorded as one code) and pneumonia (recorded as another code), for example, could be both reported in one OBX segment. Such multiple “values” would be separated by repeat delimiters. Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and Sub ID In some systems, a single observation may include fragments of more than one data type. The most common example is a numeric result followed by coded comments (CE). In this case, the logical observation can be sent in more than one OBX segment. For example, one segment of numeric or string data type for the numeric result and another segment of CE data type for coded comments. If the producer was reporting multiple coded comments they would all be sent in one OBX segment separated by repeat delimiters because they all modified a single logical observation. Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID should always be sent in sequence with the most significant OBX segment (the one that has the normal flag/units and or reference range and status flag) first. The value of OBX-6 through 12 should be null in any following OBX segments with the same OBX-3-observation identifier and OBX-4observation sub-ID. For the purpose of replacement or deletion, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID are treated as a unit. If any are replaced or deleted, they all are replaced. Coded values When an OBX segment contains values of CE data types, the observations are stored as a combination of codes and/or text."

Prefixes ranging from 10-24 (1/billion billionth) to 1024 (a billion billion) are available. The single case abbreviation for kilo (x1000) is k. A unit consisting of 1000 seconds would be abbreviated as ks, 1000 grams as kg, 1000 meters as km, and so on. Some prefixes share the abbreviation of a base unit. Farad and femto, for example, (10-18) both have the abbreviation of f. To avoid confusion, ISO forbids the use of solitary prefixes. It also deprecates the use of two prefixes in one complex unit. Thus, f always means farad, ff would mean 1 million billionth of a farad. Compound prefixes are not allowed. A unit can be raised to an exponential power. Positive exponents are represented by a number immediately following a unit’s abbreviation, i.e., a square meter would be denoted by m2. Negative exponents are signified by a negative number following the base unit, e.g., 1/m2 would be represented as m-2. Fractional exponents are expressed by a numeric fraction in parentheses: the square root of a meter would be expressed as m(1/2). The multiplication of units is signified by a period (.) between the units, e.g., meters X seconds would be denoted m.s. Notice that spaces are not permitted. Division is signified by a slash (/) between two units, e.g. meters per second would be denoted as m/s. Algebraic combinations of ISO unit abbreviations constructed by dividing, multiplying, or exponentiating base ISO units, are also valid ISO abbreviations units. Exponentiation has precedence over multiplication or division. For example, microvolts squared per hertz (a unit of spectral power) would be denoted uv2/hz and evaluated as uv 2/hz while microvolts per square root of hertz (a unit of spectral amplitude) would be denoted uv/hz(1/2) and evaluated as uv/hz½. If more than one division operator is included in the expression the associations should be parenthesized to avoid any ambiguity, but the best approach is to convert a/(b/c) to a.c/b or a.c.b1 to simplify the expression. The ISO code is a grammar for building units. The rules for building these units are found in Figures 7-6 and 7-8. Figure 7-7 should be used only with English units and should not be used in conjunction with Figure 7-8. The ISO+ table (Figure 7-9) includes the most common such units constructed from this grammar (as well as important non-ISO units). Other ISO units derived from the grammar are valid as well.

This field reflects the current completion status of the results for one Observation Identifier. It is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of “F.” Code F indicates that the result has been verified to be correct and final. Code W indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code C indicates that data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code D indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through intermediate (e.g., ‘gram positive cocci’) to final (e.g., ‘staphylococcus aureus’) should not be transmitted as C (correction); they should be transmitted as P or S (depending upon the specific case) until they are final. There are situations where the observation battery required for the order needs to be dynamically specified at the time of ordering. That is, this battery is then defined by the set of OBX segments transmitted along with the order and generated by the placing system. For example, timed measurements of serum glucose challenge tests may vary among laboratories. One institution may report them at –30, -15, 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while another may report them at –30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Master file entries may exist for each individual element of the battery but not for the battery itself. Another example may be Renin Studies where the specification may be done upon ordering without having a master file definition for each permutation of the possible element. The OBX segments in the ORM message can be used to create dynamic specifications to accommodate these permutations without defining pre-existing master file definitions for the battery itself. The result status field in the OBX can be used to indicate whether the OBX in the ORM message is used to provide a dynamic specification or is used to communicate a result as context to the order. The status of O shall be used to indicate that the OBX segment is used for a dynamic specification of the required result. An OBX used for a dynamic specification must contain the detailed examination code, units, etc., with OBX-11 valued with O, and OBX-2 and OBX-5 valued with null.

This field should be needed only rarely, because most classifications are fixed attributes of the observation ID and can be defined in the associated observation master file (see description in Chapter 8). However, there are a few cases when such controls vary with the value of the observation in a complex way that the receiving system would not want to re-calculate. An example is an antimicrobial susceptibility result. Some systems prefer to display only the susceptibility results of inexpensive antimicrobials depending upon the organism, the source of the specimen and the patient’s allergy status. The sending service wants to send all of the susceptibilities so that certain privileged users (e.g., Infectious Disease specialists) can review all of the results but nonprivileged users would see only the “preferred” antimicrobials to which the organism was susceptible. We expect that other cases also occur."

It is also needed in the case of OBX segments that are being sent by the placer to the filler, in which case the date of the observation being transmitted is likely to have no relation to the date of the requested observation. In France, requesting services routinely send a set of the last observations along with the request for a new set of observations. The date of these observations is important to the filler laboratories. In all cases, the observation date-time is the physiologically relevant date-time or the closest approximation to that date-time. In the case of tests performed on specimens, the relevant date-time is the specimen’s collection date-time. In the case of observations taken directly on the patient (e.g., X-ray images, history and physical), the observation date-time is the date-time that the observation was performed."

Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient’s weight would be mass, not mass content. Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time).

Depending on the message, the action of the control code may refer to an order or an individual service. For example, the code CA in an OMP message cancels the order. The same code in an RDS message, cancels the dispense. Very detailed explanatory notes are given at the end of this section. This field may be considered the \"trigger event\" identifier for orders. The codes fall roughly into the following three categories: a) event request Codes like \"NW\" (new order) and \"CA\" (cancel order request) are used to initiate an event. b) event acknowledgment Codes like \"OK\" (order accepted) and \"CR\" (canceled as requested) are used to reply to the event request. c) event notification Codes like \"OC\" (order canceled) and \"OD\" (order discontinued) are used to notify other applications that an event has occurred. No application reply is necessary. Event request codes are intended to initiate an event. Event acknowledgment codes are intended to reply to an application that requested an event. Event notification codes are intended to notify another application that, e.g., the filler has performed some action on an order that the other application, e.g., the placer, needs to know. Fillers, placers, and other applications can use event requests, event acknowledgments, and event notification-type trigger events interchangeably. However, certain order control codes can originate only from the filler (e.g., CR) and others can only originate from the placer (e.g., CA). Refer to section 4.19.1 for the contents of HL7 Table 0119 – Order Control Codes. 4.5.1.1.1 Table notes for order control codes of ORC a) CA A cancellation is a request not to do a previously ordered service. Confirmation of the cancellation request is provided by the filler, e.g., a message with an ORC-1-order control value of CR. b) UC An unable-to-cancel code is used when the ordered service is at a point that it cannot be canceled by the filler or when local rules prevent cancellation by the filler. The use of this code is dependent on the value of ORC-6-response flag. c) DC A discontinue request code is used to stop an ongoing ordered service. It is not the same as a cancellation request, which is used in an attempt to prevent an order from happening. d) RP, RQ, RU, RO A replacement is the substitution of one or more orders for one or more previously ordered services. The replaced orders are treated as though they were canceled. If and when an ordered service can be replaced are local site-specific determinations. Use the parent/child order control codes if the site specifies that the original order must remain intact. Do not use the replacement codes under this circumstance. For each order to be replaced, use an ORC-1-order control value of RP (request for a replacement going to a filler) or RU (an unsolicited replacement created by the filler) used by the filler to notify the placer and/or other systems). By local agreement, the ORC segment (with RP or RU) may be followed by its original order detail segment. The ORC segments (with RP or RU) must be followed by an ORC segment with an ORC-1-order control value of RO (indicating the replacement order). By local agreement, the ORC with the RO value may be followed by an order detail segment. For example, suppose that an ancillary application were replacing two OBR orders with three different orders. The sequence of segments would be as follows: Figure 4-2."

An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Placer order number. It is assigned by the placer (ordering application). It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular ordering application. The second through fourth components contain the application ID of the placing application in the same form as the HD data type (Section 2.A.36, \"HD Hierarchic designator\"). The second component, namespace ID, is a user-defined coded value that will be uniquely associated with an application. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. A given institution or group of intercommunicating institutions should establish a unique list of applications that may be potential placers and fillers and assign unique application IDs. The components are separated by component delimiters. There are three situations in which the true placer is somewhat arbitrary (and thus not unique): a) in ORC-1-order control value of RO, following an RU replacement; b) in ORC-1-order control value of CH (child orders); and c) in ORC-1-order control value of SN (send number). See the Table Notes under ORC-1-order control for the details of how the ORC-2-placer order number is assigned in these cases. The application ID list becomes one of the institution's master dictionary lists that is documented in Chapter 8. Since third-party applications (those other than the placer and filler of an order) can send and receive ORM and ORR messages, the placer application ID in this field may not be the same as any sending and receiving application on the network (as identified in the MSH segment). ORC-2-placer order number is the same as OBR-2-placer order number. If the placer order number is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR and vice versa. If both fields, ORC-2-placer order number and OBR-2-placer order number are valued, they must contain the same value. When results are transmitted in an ORU message, an ORC is not required, and the identifying placer order number must be present in the OBR segments. These rules apply to the few other fields that are present in both ORC and OBR for upward compatibility (e.g., quantity/timing, parent numbers, ordering provider, and ordering call back numbers)."

An implementation is HL7 compliant when the number of characters for this field is increased to accommodate applications that require a greater number of characters for the Filler order number.

In this case, the ORC is not required and the identifying filler order number must be present in the OBR segments. The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application. Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to \"CA\" and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself."

If ORC-9-date/time of transaction is after or equal to ORC-15-order effective date/time, the data values in the ORC and its subordinate segments took effect on the order effective date/time. If ORC-9-date/time of transaction is before the time specified in ORC-15-order effective date/time, the data values in ORC and its subordinate segments are planned to take effect on the order effective date/time. If ORC-15-order effective date/time is left blank, its value is assumed to be equal to that specified in ORC9-date/time of transaction or MSH-7-date/time of message if the transaction date/time is blank. In the case where the time specified in ORC-15-order effective date/time (for the order control code event in the same ORC segment) is different from the corresponding date/time in ORC-7-quantity/timing, the time specified in ORC-15-order effective date/time takes precedence. Thus if the ORC event is a discontinue request to the filler for a continuing order, and the order-effective date/time is prior to the end date/time of ORC-7-quantity/timing, the order effective date/time should take precedence. If the order identified in the ORC has children, the children which have not started should be canceled; if there is a child in process, it should be discontinued; if a child has progressed beyond the point where it can be discontinued, its status is unaffected."

While these parameters are understood to be usually “anded” together, the user must inspect the required Conformance Statement to properly understand each. Except in the QSC variant, the parameter names do not need to be stated in the query; they are understood to be positional based on the Conformance Statement. Each parameter field may be specified in the Conformance Statement to be of any single data type, including the complex QIP and QSC types. Parameter fields may also contain the sort control (SRT) field or the segment group (ID) field defined in Sections 5.4.5.3.1 and 5.4.5.3.2 below. Parameter fields in the QPD segment appear in the same order as in the Conformance Statement. 5.5.4.3.1 Note on QPD usage for query by example variant. Note: Query By Example: The query by example is an extension of Query By Parameter (QBP) in which search parameters are passed by sending them in the segment which naturally carries them. Thus if one wanted to perform a “find_candidates” query using query by example, one would send the demographics information on which to search in the PID and/or PD1 segments leaving blank those fields in the segment sent which are not query parameters. If, for example, religion were not one of the query parameters, PID17 would be left blank when the PID was sent in the query. Parameters which do not occur naturally in an HL7 message, such as search algorithm, confidence level, etc, would continue to be carried in the QPD segment as they are in the Query by Parameter. The segments and fields available for use as query parameters would be specified in the Conformance Statement for the query."

Fields occur in the position order defined for the query or table (unless overridden by an optional RDF segment on a stored procedure request or Virtual Table query message), separated by field delimiters. 5.6 AUXILIARY QUERY PROTOCOLS This section discusses properties of queries that can be described as global properties. These properties enable the Client and Server to deal with timing and sizing issues and to handle exceptions. 5.6.1 Immediate vs. deferred response Responses to queries can be either immediate or deferred. In the immediate mode, the responding process gives the response immediately or in a short period during which the requesting process will wait for the response. In the deferred mode, the response is returned asynchronously, as a separate message pair. Also, a time interval for the deferred transaction may be specified. In the case of immediate mode query, the Server does NOT send a General Acknowledgement (ACK). The acknowledgement of the query is contained within the response message. In the case of deferred mode, the query is acknowledged immediately by an ACK. The Server sends the deferred response at the appropriate time. The Client acknowledges the response with an ACK. In short, the deferred query transaction consists of 2 “round trips”. If an immediate mode query message is malformed, a negative ACK is immediately sent. Use cases for Deferred include 1) evaluate the query conditions at a certain point in time and then return the response. For example, At 9 AM tomorrow, evaluate query and return response. 2) produce a large report to be communicated to the Server at an off-peak hour. For example, a response containing all admissions records for the month to be sent at 4:00 a.m., or a reference lab results listing to be sent at noon. A deferred response can benefit both Server and Client in such cases, especially where the generation, communication, and receipt of segments can all be done at times of otherwise low-volume processing. If the Conformance Statement indicates that the Server will support both immediate and deferred responses, then the Client may indicate the desired value of this property by sending it in the RCP-1 Response priority field. If the Server supports only one response type, then the value specified by the Client must agree. Immediate Query Query (2 PM) Server Client Response (2:01 PM) Deferred Query Query (2 PM) Server Acknowledgement (ACK) ( 2 PM) Client Response (3 AM) Acknowledgement (ACK) (3 AM) The following examples demonstrate how the same query could be invoked in either immediate or deferred mode. 5.6.1.1 Immediate response The Client submits the following query and indicates that an immediate response is desired by setting RCP-1-Response priority to “I”.

The amount of the \"base\" specified in the \"B\" segment(s) is defined to be the quantity into which amounts specified in the \"A\" components are mixed. Thus the RXC segments as a group define the \"recipe\" for a particular amount (defined by the base segment(s)). The give amount, as defined in the RXO, does not need to correspond to this base amount. For example, the RXC segments may specify a recipe for a liter of a standard type of saline with 1 gram of a particular antimicrobial, while the give amount (from the RXO) may specify the administration of 2 liters of this IV-solution every 24 hours. The amount specified in each \"A\" segment is defined to be the quantity to be added to the amount of the base as specified in its RXC segment.

For example, the \"give\" part of the order may convey the field-representation of give 250 mg of Ampicillin, while the request to dispense part of the order may convey issue 30 tablets of generic equivalent for this outpatient prescription. The coding system used is conditional on both the nature of the medical substance or treatment ordered and site-specific implementation considerations.

This is the numeric part of the strength, used in combination with RXO-19-requested give strength units. The need for strength and strength unit fields in addition to the amount and amount units fields included in various RX_ segments requires explanation. Physicians can write a prescription for a drug such as Ampicillin in two ways. One way would be: \"Ampicillin 250 mg capsules, 2 capsules four times a day.\" In this case the give amount would be 2, the give units would be capsules, the strength would be 250 and the strength units would milligrams. However, the provider could also write the pharmaceutical treatment as \"Ampicillin 500 mg four times a day.\" In this case the give amount would be 500 and the give units would be milligrams. The strength would not be reported in the RXO segment because it is not specified; the drug could be given in two 250 mg caps or one 500 mg cap. But the pharmacist would dispense a specific capsule size and would record the strength in the RXE segment as 250 or 500, depending upon which capsule size was dispensed. Some coding systems imply the strength, units, route of administration, and manufacturer of substances within a single instructional code. NDC codes, for example, usually imply not only the medical substance, but also the strength, the units, and the form, e.g., 0047-0402-30^Ampicillin 250 MG CAPS^NDC. So all of this information can also be completely specified in RXO-1-requested give code and in the analogous CE fields in other pharmacy/treatment segments. In this case, it is not necessary to use the strength and strength units fields to specify this information."

In Position status is used by one system to inform another that the container is in position for specimen transfer (e.g., container removal from track, pipetting, etc.). In Process status is used by one system to inform another that the specific container is being processed by the equipment. It is useful as a response to a query about Container Status, when the specific step of the process is not relevant. Process Completed status is used by one system to inform another that the processing has been completed, but the container has not been released from that system. Final Standard June 2003 Left Equipment status is used by one system to inform another that the container has been released from that system. Missing status is used by one system to inform another that the container did not arrive at its next expected location. Cancelled status is used by one system to inform another that the container is no longer available within the scope of the system (e.g., tube broken or discarded). Unknown status is used by one system to inform another that the container has not been identified."

HL7 Table 0506 – Service Request Relationship Value N Description Nurse prerogative C Compound T Tapering E Exclusive S Simultaneous Comment Where a set of two or more orders exist and the Nurse, or other caregiver, has the prerogative to choose which order will be administered at a particular point in time. For example, Milk of Magnesia PO 30 ml qhs (at bedtime) Dulcolax Supp R @ hs prn Colace 100 mg capsule PO bid The nurse would be administering MOM, but may add the Colace and may also give the Dulcolax Supp as needed to promote and maintain regularity. A compound is an extempo order which may be made up of multiple drugs. For example, many hospitals have a standard item called \"Magic Mouthwash\". The item is ordered that way by the physician. The extempo items will contain multiple products, such as Maalox, Benadryl, Xylocaine, etc. They will all be mixed together and will be dispensed in a single container. A tapering order is one in which the same drug is used, but it has a declining dosage over a number of days. For example, Decadron 0.5 mg is often ordered this way. The order would look like this: Decadron 0.5 mg qid (four times a day) for 2 days, then Decadron 0.5 mg tid (three times a day) for 2 days, then Decadron 0.5 mg bid (twice a day) for 2 days, then Decadron 0.5 mg qd (daily) for 2 days, then stop. An exclusive order is an order where only one of the multiple items should be administered at any one dosage time. The nurse may chose between the alternatives, but should only give ONE of them. An example would be: Phenergan 25 mg PO, IM or R q6h prn (orally, intramuscularly, or rectally every 6 hours as needed). A simultaneous order is 2 or more drugs which are ordered to be given at the same time. A common example of this would be Demerol and Phenergan (Phenergan is given with the Demerol to control the nausea that Demerol can cause). The order could be: Demerol 50 mg IM with Phenergan 25 mg IM q4h prn (every 4 hours as needed)."
