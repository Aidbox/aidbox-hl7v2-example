# Draft

Global Preprocessors Per Segment - need to implement config so it supports global config for per-segment preprocessing configuration, and then overriding it with per-message preprocessor configs.

Add per-sender configuration support for HL7v2 preprocessing (currently sender-agnostic; required for non-conformant senders with different normalization rules).
