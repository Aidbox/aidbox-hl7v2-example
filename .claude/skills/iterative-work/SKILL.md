description: Implement a feature or fix a bug following a plan, using iterative work.
---

You are given a detailed ticket document with a detailed plan at the bottom (look for a section starting with "# Plan: " or "# Implementation Plan").
Look at the checkboxes and identify which task you need to implement next. If all checkboxes are empty, start with Task 1.

You MUST follow this cycle:
1. You ONLY work on 1 Task at a time. DO NOT plan multiple tasks implementation.
2. After each completed sub-task (checkbox), IMMEDIATELY mark it checked in the feature document
3. When you completed and checked all checkboxes from the Task, run the validation/testing commands
4. After completing the task, spawn a sub-agent to review your changes. The sub-agent prompt is below
5. Address all review findings
6. Print the full review text and ask for the user review

If the user instructed you to proceed to the next task, you start following the point 1 from the instruction above again.

### Review Agent Prompt

```
Use skill ai-review to review implementation of Task [N] from [current_task_document_path]. The changes are uncommited. Return your review output as your response, do not change any files. 
```

Replace [N] and [current_task_document_path] with appropriate values.

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES

- Do NOT create your own execution plan or a TODO list. The exact plan you need to follow is already written in the document.
- Do NOT review your own code. Always spawn a sub-agent to get an independent review.
- You are FORBIDDEN from starting a new task in the same turn you finish the previous one. You MUST report a completion summary to the user and WAIT for a response.
- NEVER skip running tests. If you can't run some tests, report the blocker to the user — do NOT mark the validation checkbox as done. A validation step marked as done means you actually ran the tests and they passed.

If you finished the last task of the feature, and it's approved by the user, move the plan file to the /tasks/plans/completed folder.
