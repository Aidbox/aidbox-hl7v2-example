# Task Plan Creator

You are creating a detailed implementation plan from an approved design document. The plan will be executed by Claude Code agents via [ralphex](https://github.com/umputun/ralphex), so it must be detailed, unambiguous, and self-contained.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify that an approved design exists:

1. Look for `tasks/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`
2. Check that frontmatter contains `status: approved`

**If no approved design exists:**
```
No approved design found for this feature.
Run /task-design first to create and approve a design, or specify the design file path.
```

**If design exists but not approved:**
```
Design exists but status is '[current-status]', not 'approved'.
Run /task-design to continue the design process.
```

## Output Location

Write the plan inside the existing design document: `tasks/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`

Add a new section `# Implementation Plan` at the end of the design document (after `# Context`).

## Plan Structure

Add the following section to the design document:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

## Overview
[2-4 sentences describing what will be implemented and why - derived from Problem Statement]

## Development Approach
- Complete each task fully before moving to the next
- Make small, focused changes
- **CRITICAL: all tests must pass before starting next task**
- **CRITICAL: update this plan when scope changes**

## Validation Commands
- `[test command]` - Run tests
- `[typecheck command]` - Type checking
- `[lint command]` - Linting (if applicable)

---

## Task 1: [Task Name]
- [ ] [Specific action item]
- [ ] [Another action item]
- [ ] Write/update tests for this task
- [ ] Run `[validation command]` - must pass before next task

---

## Task 2: [Task Name]
...

---

## Task [N-1]: Update documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with new patterns/conventions (if applicable)
- [ ] Add inline documentation for complex functions
- [ ] Update API documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Run `bun test` and `bun run typecheck` - must pass before next task

---

## Task [Final]: Cleanup design artifacts
- [ ] Remove all `DESIGN PROTOTYPE: YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` comments from codebase
- [ ] Delete any empty scaffold files that were replaced
- [ ] Update design document status to `implemented`
- [ ] Verify no prototype markers remain: `grep -r "DESIGN PROTOTYPE: YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name" src/`
- [ ] Run `bun test:all` and `bun run typecheck` - final verification

---

## Post-Completion Verification
1. **Functional test**: [Describe how to manually test the feature]
2. **Edge case test**: [Test a specific edge case manually]
3. **Integration check**: [Verify integration with existing features]
4. **No regressions**: All existing tests pass
5. **Cleanup verified**: No DESIGN PROTOTYPE comments remain
```

---

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Load Design Context

1. Read the approved design document completely
2. Read all prototype placeholder files listed in `prototype-files` frontmatter
3. Understand:
   - The problem being solved (from Problem Statement)
   - The chosen approach and rationale (from Proposed Approach, Key Decisions)
   - All affected files (from Affected Components)
   - Technical details (from Technical Details)
   - Edge cases identified (from Edge Cases and Error Handling)
   - Test cases planned (from Test Cases)
   - Review notes (from AI Review Notes)

### Phase 2: Analyze Prototype Placeholders

For each file with `DESIGN PROTOTYPE: <design-file>` markers:

1. Identify what changes are outlined
2. Determine dependencies between changes
3. Group related changes into logical tasks
4. Order tasks so dependencies are satisfied

### Phase 3: Create Task Breakdown

Convert the design into discrete, ordered tasks:

1. **Group by component**: Changes to related files go in same task
2. **Order by dependency**: Foundation tasks before tasks that depend on them
3. **Include tests**: Every task must have test checkboxes
4. **Add validation gates**: Every task ends with passing validation commands
5. **Keep tasks focused**: 2-8 checkboxes per task is ideal

**Task ordering principles:**
- Types/interfaces before implementations
- Core logic before integrations
- Unit tests alongside implementation
- Integration tests after components exist
- Documentation second-to-last
- Cleanup last

### Phase 4: Write the Implementation Plan

Add `# Implementation Plan` section to `tasks/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` with:

1. Overview derived from design's Problem Statement
2. Development approach guidelines
3. Validation commands appropriate for this project
4. Detailed tasks with specific checkboxes
5. Documentation task (second-to-last)
6. Cleanup task to remove prototype placeholders (last)
7. Post-completion verification steps

### Phase 5: Verify Plan Quality

Critically and thoroughly review the plan before presenting to user:

- Plan is written inside the design document under `# Implementation Plan`
- Every affected file from design's Affected Components is covered in tasks
- Every prototype placeholder location has a corresponding task
- Tasks are ordered so dependencies are satisfied
- Each task has 2-8 specific checkboxes
- Every task ends with validation gate
- Tasks reference design's Technical Details for implementation specifics
- Tasks reference design's Edge Cases for error handling
- Tasks cover ALL test cases mentioned in the design document
- There's a task focused on documentation updates (CLAUDE.md, docs, user guides, inline comments)
- There's a task focused on cleaning up all DESIGN PROTOTYPE markers
- Post-completion verification steps are defined

### Phase 6: Update the document status

Change the design document status to `planned`.

## Task Writing Guidelines

### Good Task Structure

```markdown
### Task 3: Implement user validation middleware

- [ ] Create `src/middleware/validate-user.ts` with `validateUser()` function
- [ ] Validate JWT token from Authorization header
- [ ] Return 401 for missing/invalid tokens, 403 for expired tokens
- [ ] Add middleware to protected routes in `src/routes/index.ts`
- [ ] Write unit tests in `src/middleware/validate-user.test.ts`
- [ ] Write integration test for protected endpoint
- [ ] Run `bun test` and `bun run typecheck` - must pass before next task
```

### Bad Task Structure (avoid)

```markdown
### Task 3: Add auth
- [ ] Implement authentication
- [ ] Add tests
```

### Checkbox Guidelines

Each checkbox should be:
- **Specific**: Name exact files, functions, endpoints
- **Verifiable**: Clear success criteria
- **Atomic**: One logical action per checkbox
- **Ordered**: Later checkboxes may depend on earlier ones

Include checkboxes for:
- Implementation steps (reference prototype placeholder locations)
- Test creation/updates
- Error handling (reference design's Edge Cases section)
- Edge case coverage
- Documentation updates (inline comments for complex logic)

---

## Testing Requirements

Every task MUST include testing checkboxes:

```markdown
- [ ] Write unit tests for [specific function/module]
- [ ] Write integration tests for [specific flow]
- [ ] Add test cases for edge cases: [list them]
- [ ] Run `[test command]` - must pass before next task
```

Test coverage should include:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error conditions
- Edge cases (empty inputs, boundary values, concurrent access)
- Integration with adjacent components

## Converting Prototype Placeholders to Tasks

### From new file scaffold:

**Prototype:**
```typescript
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// DESIGN PROTOTYPE: 2026-01-28-feature.md
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// export interface UserSession { ... }
// export function createSession(userId: string): UserSession
// export function validateSession(token: string): boolean
```

**Task:**
```markdown
### Task 2: Implement session management module

- [ ] Replace prototype scaffold in `src/session/manager.ts` with actual implementation
- [ ] Implement `UserSession` interface as specified in design's Technical Details
- [ ] Implement `createSession()` function with JWT generation
- [ ] Implement `validateSession()` function with expiry checking
- [ ] Export all public types and functions
- [ ] Write unit tests in `src/session/manager.test.ts`
- [ ] Run `bun test` and `bun run typecheck` - must pass before next task
```

### From inline markers:

**Prototype:**
```typescript
// DESIGN PROTOTYPE: 2026-01-28-feature.md
// Add parameter → mappingType: MappingTypeName = "loinc"
export function generateConceptMapId(sender: SenderContext): string {
```

**Task:**
```markdown
### Task 4: Update generateConceptMapId for multiple mapping types

- [ ] Add `mappingType: MappingTypeName = "loinc"` parameter to `generateConceptMapId()`
- [ ] Import `MappingTypeName` from `src/code-mapping/mapping-types.ts`
- [ ] Use `MAPPING_TYPES[mappingType].conceptMapSuffix` instead of hardcoded `-to-loinc`
- [ ] Update all existing call sites (should work with default parameter)
- [ ] Add unit tests for new parameter with different mapping types
- [ ] Run `bun test` and `bun run typecheck` - must pass before next task
```

## Validation Commands

Always include commands that verify correctness. Get these from the project's CLAUDE.md or package.json:

```markdown
## Validation Commands
- `bun test` - Run all tests
- `bun run typecheck` - Type checking
- `bun run lint` - Linting (if applicable)
- `bun run build` - Verify build succeeds (if applicable)
```
