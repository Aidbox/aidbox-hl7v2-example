# Guide backed by a research

Tell the user everything they need to know about $ARGUMENTS in order to successfully work with it on this project.
 
Tell why it's used, how it's used, what are caveats, foundational knowledge, etc. Search web and think hard to make a comprehensive guide for the user.

**Output**:

Make an .md file in the `data/local/guides/` directory. The guide should be easy to read for a person who is absolutely not familiar with the topic, but avoid oversimplifications that will prevent a deeper understanding of the topic.
